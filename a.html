Williamson’s 59-run stand with Shakib — who also took two wickets in KKR innings — for the fourth wicket eased the pressure on the Sunrisers as they reached 139 for 5 in 19 overs to notch up their third win on the trot.
						Williamson struck exactly fifty off 44 deliveries, hitting four boundaries and a six to help Sunrisers chase down the small target of 139.<br>

But the South African’s dismissal, to D’Arcy Short’s part-time chinaman, allowed Rajasthan a foot in the door.

An atypically aggressive Ajinkya Rahane had fallen after miscuing an off-cutter from Chris Woakes, when Samson took over.<br><strong>Best batsman</strong><br>The 23-year-old from Kerala has looked Rajasthan’s best batsman this IPL; he delivered yet again, putting the likes of Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler in the shade. Samson cleared the ropes 10 times, striking the ball with tremendous ease throughout.Indeed, at one point he seemed to be dealing entirely in sixes; it was not until the 19th over, by which time he had produced eight hits over the fence, that he struck his first four. Short balls were sent soaring over the leg-side boundary. Fuller ones, like two of Kulwant Khejroliya’s in the 18th over, were effortlessly chipped over long-off. <br>Umesh Yadav had a terrible day, conceding 59 off his four overs, while Khejroliya (40 off three) and Woakes (47 off four) did not escape punishment either. In fact, only Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal emerged with any credit among RCB’s bowlers.<br>Samson and Buttler added 73 runs (off only 37 balls) for the fourth wicket as the former, who had begun carefully, went berserk.With Rahul Tripathi later joining in the fun, Rajasthan hammered 88 off the last five overs, including 75 off the final four.It was an assault that would put the total beyond RCB’s reach.

With Dhawan also, getting the boundaries with ease, it looked like for a while that the Sunrisers would chase down the target in quick time.<br>But the match turned on its head after the first wicket fell in the form of Saha in the fourth over. Sunil Narine delivered as soon as he was introduced in the fourth over as he induced Saha to edge behind the wicket to Dinesh Karthik.Dhawan, who was in fine touch in the last two matches, was out cheaply this time for seven as he became Narine’s second victim in the sixth over, clean-bowled by the West Indian off-spinner and suddenly Sunrisers were in trouble at 46 for 2.<br>Manish Pandey did not last long as he was trapped LBW by Kuldeep Yadav for four in the ninth over. Run rate drastically dropped as the Sunrisers reached to 62 for 3 at halfway mark, needing 77 from the remaining 10 overs.But the visiting side had their men in captain Willaimson and Shakib to do the job in the middle and they steadied the innings with a 59-run association to set up the win for their side.Earlier, a splendid bowling show spearheaded by pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, coupled with a brilliant fielding display, helped Sunrisers restrict KKR to a modest 138/8 in a rain-interrupted first innings.Returning to action after a one-match injury lay-off, Bhuvneshwar once again shone at the death, claiming 3/26 as KKR’s rejigged batting order looked in a complete disarray.<br>Opting to bowl after winning the toss, SRH’s overseas duo of Billy Stanlake (2/21) and Shakib Al Hasan (2/22) put the brakes in the middle overs, triggering a collapse after a one-hour rain delay.An integral part of KKR’s twin-IPL winning campaigns, Shakib became the thorn against his former team and young Australian pacer Stanlake gave him a fine support.The left-arm spinner from Bangladesh took the two key wickets of Chris Lynn (49 off 34 balls; 7x4, 1x6) and Sunil Narine (9) to play a big role in restricting KKR to a small total.<br>Lynn was the lone KKR crusader in the middle but a sensational diving catch by Shakib off his own bowling denied the Australian a half-century as the star Bangladeshi cricketer once again did his job in the middle overs.Bhuvenshwar gave the first breakthrough by dismissing Robin Uthappa (3) in the third over after a successful use of DRS.KKR showed defensive strategy early on to hold back their in-form opener Narine, a move that did not help much as their batting order did not seem convincing with U-19 World Cup winner Shivam Mavi coming in at No. 7.<br>Bhuvneshwar’s breakthrough and a tidy two-run over by Stanlake had KKR struggling for 23/1 in four overs before Lynn and Rana seized the momentum in two overs off Siddharth Kaul and Rashid Khan who leaked 14 and 12 overs respectively in their first overs.';
